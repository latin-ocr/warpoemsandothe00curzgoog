THE DEAD SOLDIER

“ IND gentlemen of France,
A·marching out to war,

I pray you, an you phase,
Give ch'eer to my suitor.’'

“How shall 1 give him cheer

Who is to me unknown ?''
“To know him is not hard,

He hath white armour on3

“The eross he bears is white,
His spurs are made of gold,

A lance, with silver head
Well gildal, he doth hold.’'

“Weep no more, lady fair,
For he is dead and gone3
