sono on THE menemus

Belgians, dance and sing our glory
On this consecrated ground-

Eyes are buming, braine are turning-
Heed notl dance the meny roundl

Come with flaming becchen brancha,
And the music of the drum3

Come, and strew them on the earth-heaps
Where our dead lie buried, comel

Choose a day like this, my brothers,
When the wind a pattern weaves

â€™Mid the shivering poplar trec-tops,
When the scent of fallen leaves

Floats like perfume through the woodlnnd,
As it doth tnday, that so

Some sweet odour of our good land
May be with them, down below.

We will pray the earth they held so

Dent, to rock them in her arm,
On her vast and ample bosom
Once again to make them warm,
