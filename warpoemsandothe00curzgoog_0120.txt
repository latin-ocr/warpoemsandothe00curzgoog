THE SPRING ROAD

THE road is pink with apple trees—

I go to meet my love,
So fresh and frail-the ring-doves’ wings

Make white the sky above.

The apple trees are thick with bloom-
Ι go to meet my love-

The ring-doves court amid the grows,
She is my mede-dove.

The dew-drops deck the fields like pearls-
Ι go to meet my love-

The fielde are white and gold'-her laugh
Rings in the air above.

The limpid streame, all full of senge-
1 go to meet my love-

⁸ im, white with deisiee md gold with buttercupe.
