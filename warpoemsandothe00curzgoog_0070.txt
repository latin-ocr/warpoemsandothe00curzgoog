THE wounmeo sommi< '49

The novices-beneath their caps
They blush at his coarse talliee

If at hit side, thinking he sieeps,
The sister hreathes a prayer,
Stntightway astir he iills his pipe

And whistles a hored air.

What use to him their faithful wateh,
The care that never ceasesi
He knows his leg is lost and done,

And he'll be haeked to piecee.

He's very angry-Let him hei
Here no one knowt impatience

There reigns an atmosphere that soothee

And cows the rudest patients.

Slow is the spell, but sure, that wields
This band, to service given,
With fingere soit they touch the wounds,
And eost-ly speak of Heaven.
