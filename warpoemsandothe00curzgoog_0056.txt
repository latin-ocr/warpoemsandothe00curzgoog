UNDAY it is in Flendus,
And, blue as flax, the sky
O’er plain and windmill stretches
Its peaceful canopy.
The bells, high in the helfries,

Are singing, blithe and gay,
The overflowing gladness

Of coming Holiday.

Ring out! Ring on! Ring loudly
The merry Flemish peall

But suddenly there rises

To heaven a cry of sear-
Quick! To the belh„ quickly! -
The ravenous horde is here,

See them! the crows and vultures,

Sowers of dire alarms3
