Tnn Monn’s nnnnn nnn 79

When hands his drooping eyelids touch, and gently
sold them down
To rest for all eternity on eyeballs turned to stone3

When on his dry and rigid limbs the damp begins

to for
And in his rz'ting entrails sprouts the birthplace of

the worm;

When men his body list, as soon as night-time is
abroad,
And lay it with the ancient dead who sleep beneath

the sward3

When prompt oblivion closes tight his grave within
its grasp,

And makes it as a strangled book shut by an iron ,
clasp ς

Look on his'humble memory, with mercy in Thy
face,

ὲ And, where Thou art in glory, Lord, grant to his
soul a place!
