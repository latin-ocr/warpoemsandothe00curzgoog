ΙΝ THE AFGHAN wAR 57

In the distant Asian passes
The banner of England blew3
Upon the height she saw him fight-
F igffling, he saw her too.

The golden flood was darkened-
A shadow before her came3
Within the room was the wraith of doom,

Outside the great red dame.

A cry broke on the stillness—

“Great God”! she reeled and fell,
And the sun dropped down on field and town,

And vanished was the spell.

In the distant Asinn passes ,
Α pale corpse faced the sky-
Ohl dying breath of lise in death!
Oh! hidden mysteryl
