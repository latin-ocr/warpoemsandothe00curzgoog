IDEM 175
“So many that one life fulfilled of old

Seek diverse lives-such hope hath change-
Pitiful it is and wondrous to behold,

Yea, laughable and strangel

“Now murdered Orpheus, from the hate he bore

To woman’s tace, would be a swan,

And Agamemnon for his woes of yore

An eagle’s plumes put on.

ί “ Mocking Thersites picks an ape's disguise,

And Thamyris a nightingale's 3
Great Ajax, wrathful for the stolen prize,
A lion's fury hails.

ζ “The runner’s meed would Atalanta own,

Epeus a handmaid’s skill of handsr
But grave Odysseus, sad and weary grown

From toils in many lands,
