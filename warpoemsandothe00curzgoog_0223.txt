202 AMOURS DE VOYAGE

E'en in those fair open fields that incurve to thy
bkautiful hollovv,
Nemi, imbedded in wood, Nemi inurned in the hill!
Eastward, or Northward, or West? I wander and
ask ns I wander,
me, yet eager and sure-“where shall 1 come

to my love ὶ”
“Whitherward hasten to καὶ her? Ye daughters
of Italy tell me,
Graceful and tendet and dark, Is she consorting
with you?”
Thou that outelimbest the torrent, that tendest thy
goare to the summit,
Call tome, child of the Alp, has she been seen
on the heights?
Italy, farewell I bid thee, for whither she leads me,
I follow,
Farewell the vineyard‚ for 1, where I but guess
her, must go.
Weariness, welcome, and labour, wherever it be, if
at last it
Bring me in mountain or plain into the sight of
my love.
