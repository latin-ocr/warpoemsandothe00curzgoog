IDEM
ANGLICE REDDITUM

¹ I SING of that strange chance which fell to Er,
Armenius the Pamphylian's son,
In ghostly realms sole mortal traveller
Ere yet his days were done.

For that he died not, but the Judgment sm,
To Socrates the Seer was told,
Which thing did god-like Plato for a law
Of spirit-Life unfold.

Ten days the warrior’s corse amid the slain

Lay slain, yet no corruption knew3
Then waking on the pyre to life again,
This marvel passed in vieW.

“In a strange shadowy place ’twixt earth and sky,’'
Quoth he, “the Judgment·thrones are set,

Before whose steps a pallid company,
The unnumhered dead, are met.
