DEDICATORY
BELGIUM

HEARTSTRUCK she stands-Our Lady of all

Sorrows-
Circled with ruin, sunlr in deep amare,
Facing the shadow of her dark to-morrows,
Mourning the glory of her yesterdays.

Yet is she queen, by every royal token,
There where the storm of desolation swirled3
Crowned only with the thorn-despoiled and
broken-
Her kingdom is the heart of all the world.

She made her breast a shield, her sword a splendour,
She rose like flame upon the darkened ways:

So, through the anguish of her proud emender,
Breaks the clear vision of undying praise!

From The Notion
