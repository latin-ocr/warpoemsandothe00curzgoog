'“Anlon when all that host before her face

Is ranged, a herald from her knees
Lifting the lots, ascendeth a high place
And sounds her just decrees.

“‘The word of Lachesis, the eldest born
Of the dread Law, Necessity,-
Lo now, ye souls of mortals, a new dawn
Os mortal life is nigh!

“ ‘ Yours is the choice of fates! He iirst shall choose
Who draweth first. Of Righteousness
That knows no master, each shall gain or lose
Honouring her more or less.

“‘His be the blame-but blameless is High God i’

This said, the lots he scatters wide

And spreads the types of life. And at his nod
They take them and decide.

“For there all lives of men and living things,
Fair and ili-fortuned, and the mean,
Beggars and heroes, citizens and kings,
And birds and beasts, are seen.
