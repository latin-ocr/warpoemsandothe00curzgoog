RANSLATION of the poeny of one eouuny

into the language aud metue of another is an‘

amiable hobby to which many persons-aud, it

j would soem, ‘public men' iu particular*—are

prone. As a rule it possesses little interest or

¹ atuoction save for the author of the experiment.

¹ It is certainly in that light that I have always

regarded aud occasionally praetised it, and I had

no idea of ever asking the public to share the
doubout results of ruy labours.

Quite receutly, however, having sent to the
onsenvsn a series of translations into English of

some of the beautiful and touchiug poems ou the
EuropeanWarand the suffirings ofhis country, which
have appeared in its columns from the pen ofthe

'¹ eg. Lord Wotestey, Lora Baby, Lord Carnorum, Lori
Cramer, Mes Gla istoru, ond many others.
