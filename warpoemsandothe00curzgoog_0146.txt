THE SECOND CIRCLE1 ¹25

And there do many, who till now were dumb,
Blaspheme the Power Divine.

To such a torment is condemned the hand
Of carnal sinners, who to lust
Enslaved their reasons in foul bondage, end, ⁴
As sterlings in a gust

During cold weather, on their wings unfurled,
In swarming companies are blown,
So the bad spirits by that blast are whirled
Here, there, and up and down!

No hope their woeful destiny allays
Of test, or e’en of milder pains3
And, as one sees alost, what time their lays
They chent, a file of canes,

Α So saw .1· flock, hy that tempestuous breeze
Upborne‚ and wailing like a dirge‚

The shades--whereat Isquestioned, “ Who are these,

Whom the black air doth scourge?''
