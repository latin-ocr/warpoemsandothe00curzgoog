THE WOUNDED SOLDIER
IN THE CONVENT

WHAT is that clnttering noise I hear
Through the still convent ringing?
It is the carriage·ambulance
A wounded soldier bringing.

Upon his cont the blood-spots shine3
He limps-nt shell has caught him—

His gun he uses for a crutch‚
Descending‚ to support him.

A veternn he, with neree monstache-
The triple stripen he's wearing-
All prades and hypocriten he louhen,

And starts by loudly swening.

Well-nigh insulting are his looks,
With illbred gibes he rallies
