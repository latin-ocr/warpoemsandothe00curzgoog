THE stNG''iz³6X1)'³³ ”⁴⁶³1S1‘'''‘
Gliding amid the grass, are not
So supple as my love.

The air is drunk with scents of May-

Ι go to meet my love-
And Ι am drunk with her fair face,

Each day 1 live and move.

Under the blue‚ astir with wings-
Ι go to meet my love—

Ohl pink and white the roadway is
That leads me to my love!
