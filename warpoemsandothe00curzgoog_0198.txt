IDEM

“The idle pastirne of an easeful soul

After long search doth hardly find,
And boasteth this the fairest of the whole
Vouchsafed to mortal kind.

ξ “Then each to Lachesis must past aride,

In order of the lot he witled,

To whom she giveth a celestial guide

To see his choice futfilted.

“ F irst beneath Clotho's hand the angel leads-
She on the whirrr'ng shaft the lot

. Weaves close. Then Atropos the labour speeds

That none may loose the knot.

ἱ “Thence onward passing ’neath the awful throne,

Necessity's‚ they journey on Ἴ

Thro’ hest and scorching toa desert lone,

The Plain Oblivion.

“There doth no herb begotten ever bless
, The utter waste. At eventide

h They see the river of Unmindfulness
And camp the wave beside.
