THE MONK'S DEATH BED 77
When the poor body in affright, as fearful Death

draws nigh,
Grows rigid in a final throe of haplees energ75

When ae the gethering shadows creep about his
clouded mind,

He fumbles with his dying hands, if they the eroes
may find3

When ashes on his shaven brow are laid, nnd on
his breast

His stiffening arms are crossed, that so hie ending
may be blest 3

When the last perdon is pronounced‚ and he is·
given the Host-

Α lamp by nighna sun by day, to guide his flitting
ghost3

When the last drop of sweat is wiped from off hie
pallid sace

, Under the glimmering tapers that keep vigil in thet

place 3
