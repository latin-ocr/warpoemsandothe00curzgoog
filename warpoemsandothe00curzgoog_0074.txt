THE ENGLISH FLAG
THE FRENCH CANADIAN AND HIS SON

“ IT is the flag of Englandl
Stainless, against the sky,
Where is the land but sees it
Floating in majesty?

“It gleams on every shoreline‚
Where progrees forward sweeps,
Beyond the furthest foreste,
Beyond the stormiest deeps.

“And wheresoe’er man's spirit

Feres on, it streams before,
Like Noah's dove, or lightning

From Sinai flashed of yore.

“Forget the days of tempest,
And low, my son, incline,

Because teday this banner
Floats 0'er thy head and mine.''
