IDEM . 169

“And one more broad, and one more narrow showS,

And one more bright, and one more dim,
One swift‚ one slower. And in ordered rows

On every circle’s rim

“Eight Sirens do eternally revolve,

Each upon each revolving sphere,
And from their lips one liquid note dissolve

Harmonious and clear.

“ And there three daughters of the Law Sublime,
The Fates, white-robed and garlanded‚
From their lixed thrones do with the Sirens rhyme

How all is perfected.

“What things of old have been doth Lachesis,

Atropos what are yet to be,
Responsive chant3 but Clotho that which is

Hymos everlastingly.

“And each an inner or an outer ring ’
Will touch, that it may smoothly slide,

Save Lachesis, that with dest fingering
Doth every orbit guide.
