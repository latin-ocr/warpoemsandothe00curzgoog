TO THE GREAT KING

Whereso'er you will to lead us,
We will come full fain,

If you bid us shed our life-blood,
sire, 'tis yours to draini

We will march to Ghent and Antwerp,
Aerschot, Termond, Louvain,
Rid our country of tho monsters
Who oppress it—but in vain-
Brussols and Likge recapture,
Cross the river at Viso,
At your side see Aix’ towers
Rise against a brighter day.
Till one morning, while the cymbals
And the bands make srenzied din,

We will see you ride triumphant ’
Down the Lim-walin at Berlin!

Wheresoe'er you will to lead us,
We will come full fain,

If you bid us shed our life-blood,

Sire, 'tis yours to draini
