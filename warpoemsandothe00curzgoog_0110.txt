THE HANDs

'HE hands I see in dreamland
My destiny allure,
Have offered me frail roses
And far-off lilies pure.

The hands I fain v'zould capture ι

For these strange ministerings
Upon their taper fingers

Are hung with antique rings. ’

The hands to cool the sever
of my poor lips and eyes,

Are sofar, more caressing,
Than dreams of Paradise.

Whene’er Ι think I’ve m'et them
My soul in doubt has been.
Ah! can it be that never
Those hands in life were seen?
