IDEM
ANGLICE REDDITUM

O SEA-BORN Thetis, know that when
His mother's torch is lit

Memnon awakes and cries aloud,
Fired by the warmth of it.

Beneath the brow of Libyan heights,
Where Nilus cuts in twain

The city of the glorious gates,

He wakes to life again.

Yet thine Achilles, who in fight
Neâ€™er slaked his savage joy,

On the Thessalian plains is mute,

Is mute on those of Troy.
