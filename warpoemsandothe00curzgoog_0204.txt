IDEM 183

What tho’ the hungry moons make good their loss
in the heavens
We, when our spirits have fied
Where is the good Aeneas, and Tullus the weslthy,
and AncuS,
Are butas dust and a shade.
Who can tell if the gods will increase by the grant
of to·m0rrow
What has been counted to·day?
Greedy thy heir, but of all thou hast given the
self that thou lovest
Nought can he carry away.
Once thou art perished and gone, and, high on his
stately tribunal,
Minos has uttered thy doom,
Eloquence, goodness, and birth, Torquatus, will not
avail thee
E'er to return from the tomb.
Not, tho' Diana may plead, will chaste Hippolytus ever
Quit the infernal domain3
Not tho’ he love him, can Theseus his own
Pirithous waken,
Bound in oblivion’s chain.
