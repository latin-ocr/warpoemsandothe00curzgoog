SONG OF· THE BELGIANS 11
So that haply‚ as they slumher,

They may dream of battles new,
Dream that Bruesels is retaken,
That Malinee is theirs aneu,
That Namur, Liege, and Louvein
see their armies enter in,
Till they thunder, in the under·
World‚ into a waste Berlin!

Reclr not that your wounds ure hleeding,
Reck not that your voice is weak:
Deeper than the roar of cannon,
Higher than the battle-shriek,
E'en although your wounds ure hleeding,
E’en although your hart-stringo break,
Sing of hope and hate unshaken,
’Neath this fair autumnal sun:
Sing hou, when the temptet whispered,
“Sweet is vengeance, when 'tis done,’'
said we louder, “We ure prouder,
Mercy's garland to have won’'!
