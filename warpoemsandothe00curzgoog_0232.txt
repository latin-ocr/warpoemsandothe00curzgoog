THE VISION OF MIRZAH 211

The heights ascending, plunge in solemn thought,
Wondering if things be what they seem-
“Truly‚’' I said, “is man a thing of nought,
And life an empty dream.’'

κ Thus musing, ofa chance I cast my eyes

Towards a high roche, no space away,
Whereon sat one who wore a shepherd's guise,
And on a pipe did play.

Sweet was the note, and sweet the tuneful rhyme,
Α Sweet as celestial melodies
That greet the souls of good men dead, what time
Ἴ They come to Paradise,

³ And, at the sound, the mernory doth depart
Of the last agonies they felt,

⁴ And for Heaven’s joys they are prepared. My heart
¹ With hidden blies did melt.

Many there are who, journeying that way,
Have by those airs enraptured been3
‘Tis said a Spirit doth the music play,
But ne’er by man is seen.
