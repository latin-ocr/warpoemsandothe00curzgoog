fit into one another3 . . . The first and outerrnost
whorl has the rim broadest, and the seven inner whorls
are narrower. . . . The largest is spangled, and the
seventh is brightest3 the eighth coloured b the
reflected light of the seventh3 the second an fifth
are in colour like one another, and yellower than the
preceding3 the third has the whitest light 3 the fourth
is reddish 3 the sixth is in whitcness second. Now
the whole spindle has the same motion 3 but, as the
whole revolves in one direction, the seven inner
circles move slowly in the other, and of these the
swiftest is the eighth 3 next in swiftness are the seventh,
sixth, and fifth, which move together3 third in swift·
ness appeared to move according to the law of this
reversed motion the fourth 3 the third appeared fourth
and the second fifth. The spindle turns on the knees
of Necessity3 and on the upper surface of each circle
is a siren, who goes round with thern, hymning a
single tone or note. The eight together form one
harmony3 and round about, at equal intervals, there
is another band, three in number, each sitting upon
her throne : these are the Fates, daughters of Necessity,
who are clothed in white robes and have chaplets
upon their heads, Lachesis and Clotho and Atropos,
who accompany with their voices the harmony of the
sirens-—Lachesrs singing of the past, Clotho of the
present, Atropos of the future3 Clotho from time to
time assisting with a touch of her right hand the A
revolution of the outer circle of the whorl or spindle,
and Atropos with her left hand touching and guiding
the inner ones, and Lachesis laying hold of either in
turn, first with one hand and then with the other.
