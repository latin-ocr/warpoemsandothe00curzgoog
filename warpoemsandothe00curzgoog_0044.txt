THE FLIGHT INTO ENGLAND

FORWARD through the dark blue night,
Forward the wanderers pressed,
Joseph trudged, at the ass‘ head,
In front, and took no rest,
And the Mother clasped the infant child

Against her empty breast.

Forward through the dark blue night
They trotted, six leaguoe hence,

six leagues of ssight from city walls
And soldiers in their tents,

From bloody men and the woeful eries
Of the Holy Innocents. ,

“What seekest thou so fast, old man,
Along with thy young wife ?''
