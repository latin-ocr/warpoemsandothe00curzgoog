70 THE Two volcsss

In some good cause, nor in mine own,
To perish‚ wept for, honour’d‚ known,
And like ι warrior overthrown:

Whose eyes are dim with glorious tem,
When, soil’d with noble dust, he hears
His country’s war-song thrill his ears:

Then dying osa mortal stroke,
What time the foeman’s line is broke‚

And all the war is roll’d in smoke.
