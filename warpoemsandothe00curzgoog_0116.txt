TEARS rain within my heart, .

As rain falls on the town,
Oh! wherefore is my heart

With heaviness bowed down?

011 soft sound of the rain
On earth and roos-tops falling!
Oh! sweet voice of the rain
The dreary beart enthrallingl

In my disconsolate heart

Tears rain without a reas0n3
Senseless thy grief, Oh beart,
That naught hast known of treason!
