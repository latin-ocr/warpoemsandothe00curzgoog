IDEM
ANGLICE REDDITUM

GONE are the snows‚ and the grass is springing

anew in the meadows,
Leaves are again on the trees3
Earth pursueth her change and the dwindling floods
of the rivers
Flow by their borders at ease3
Safely, the dance as she leads, may the Gracc with
her nymphs and her sisters,
Fling her apparel aside.
Hark‚ as it chases the day, to the plaint of the
hour, and the season—
“Everything dies, and hasdied l'’
Loosed are the frosts by the Zephyr, the Spring is
swallowed by Summer,
Summer will perish apace
Soon as the Autumn its fruits has shed, then
cometh the Winter
With its benumbing embrace.
