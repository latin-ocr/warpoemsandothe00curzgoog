THE BLIND MAN AND HIS SON 29

Far from the fatherland3
How comes it that these tones are not
Thone of an unknown land ?''
“Father, we are in England Ι”

“I feel in all the air around
Freedom’s sweet breath respire,

I feel celestial fingers creep
Along my quivering lyre3

The birds, the trees, the babbling streams
Speak tome of our home,

Why does my grief less bitter gron
And rest so dean become?''
“Father, we are in England! ”

“Bend down upon thy knees, my son,

That, dreaming of our home, we two
May kiss the soil of England l'’
