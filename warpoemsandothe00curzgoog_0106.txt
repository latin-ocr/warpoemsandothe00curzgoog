YOUR HANDS AND EYES

GIVE me your hands, give me your eyes,
Your eyes that sparkle in my dream3
My troubled heert to exorcise
Give me your hande, give me your eyes,
Stnrs that beguile me as they gleam.

Give me your eyes, give me your hands,
Your hands with their magician'sspe113

To guide me through the unknown lande

Give me your eyes, give me your hands,
Your hands, Primos, in mine to dwell.

Give me your hande, give me your eyes,
Like stars that rise ethwart the nightÍ¾
To lend our love new ecstasies

Give me your hands, give me your eyes,
The shadows of my dream to light.
