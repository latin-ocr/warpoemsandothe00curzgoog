THE MYTH OF ER 155

But already in the next generation Aristotle, his suc-
cessor and pupil‚ declared that his writings were
something midway between prose and poetry; and
' few will dispute that the allegory here translated is a
product of the highest poetic imagination, lending
itself as readily to the idiom and rhythm of verse as to
the form and diction of prose.

Some condensation has been required in parts of the

narrative unsuited to poetical rendering or superfluous
to the tale, but wherever possible Ι have adhered to
the actual words and phrases of Plato. I had contem-
plated printing the Greek text opposite to my render-
ing, but have concluded that it would be more helplul
to the majority of readers if I were to substitute for
itan English prose translation. l have therefore, with
the permission of Balliol College and the Clarendon
Press‚ Oxford, adopted Dr. Jowett’s version lor the
purpose.

There isa similarity of subject-matter and even of
treatment in the three Visions from Plato, Dante and
Addison, contained in Part ΙΙ of this book, which has
seemed to justify the adoption of a common tnetre for
the purpose of translation into English]
