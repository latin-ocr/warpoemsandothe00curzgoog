THE BELGIAN FLAG

Ψ

RED for the blood of soldiers,
Black, yellow and ted-
Black for the tears of momen,
Black, yellow and ted-
And yellow for the light and fleme
of the ἥρως where the blood is shea!

To the glorious flag, my children,
Hark! the call your country givae,
To the flag in serried order!
He who dies for Belgium lives!

Red fot the purple of heroes,
Black, yellow and ted-

Black sor the veils of widows
Black, yellow and red-

And yellow fot the shining crown

of the victora who have bled!
