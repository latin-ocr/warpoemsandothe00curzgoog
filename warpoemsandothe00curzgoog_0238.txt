· THE v1s10N OF M1RzAH 217

Who as they ssutter from that feathered dante,
On the mid-arches poise?

“ These creatures ’'—so he answered my behest-
“Are Superstition, Love, Despair,
Envy and Avarice, who life infest,
And many a kindred care.’‘ Ι

Deeply I sighed, and spake, “Alasl how rife
With misery is mortal breathl

In vain is man—tormented thus in life,
And swassowed up in death.’'

But he, with pity for my seul-in-doubt,
Bade me that prospect to pass by,
Saying, “ Regerd no more, where man starts out

To find Eternity‚

· But forward cast thine eyes across the deep

Yonder to that dense mist, whereto
The tide doth all those generations sweep
Who drop and fall from vieW.
