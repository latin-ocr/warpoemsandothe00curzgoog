HE sung what spirit thro’ the whole man is
‘nan

Everywhere 2113 how heavens God'n laws approve

And think it ren eternally to move:

How the kind sun usefully comes and goes,

Wann it himself, yet gives to man repone:

He sung how arth blots the moon's gilded nane

whiln soolish men beat sounding bran in vain,

Why the great waters her slight horns obey,
Her changing horns not constanter than they3

He sung how grisly comets hung in air,

Why swords and plagues attend their fatal hair,
God’s beacons for the world, drawn up so sar ,
Το publish ill, and raise all earth to war.
