THE shcoND cmcLE 129

Many an ancient havalier and dame-
Whereag sor ruth, I cried

As one confounded, “Poet, with that pair
To speak awhile is in my mind,
Who fly together, hovering in the air
So light upon the wind.”

And he to me, “Ere long when they draw near
Thou wilt behold them, and shalt pray
By that sad passion which has brought them here,
And they will come straightway.”

Soon as the wind inclines them in its course

“ Oh! troubled souls‚'’ aloud 1 cry,

“Come πον, that with us ye may hold discourse,
Α If haply none deny.”

As doves by longing called, with outspread wing
Fly steady to their happy nest,
By will horne onwards, so, from out the ring

That around Dido pressed‚
