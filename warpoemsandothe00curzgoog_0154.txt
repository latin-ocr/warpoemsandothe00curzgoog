THE SECOND CIRCEE 133

Still doth the manner wound me-Love, who'll ne’er
In loved ones love remit,

“ Caught me so closely in the sels-same snare,
That in no wise its hold abates!
⁵ Love led us to a single death. Elsewhere

Cain’s place the murderer waits.”

After those wounded spirits Ι had heard,

What tendet thoughts, what yeerning pain
Have brought them hitherto this dolorous pass!”
Theo, turned to them again,

My tears in grief and pity flow,
But, tell me, in the season of sweet sighs,
By what it was, and how,
