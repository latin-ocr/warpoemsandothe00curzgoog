THE MONK’S DEATH BED

HAVE merey on the aged monk who is about
to die,

Receive his soul into Thy hands, we pray Thee, Lord
Most High!

When evil spirits cry to him that that enthroned

wer
Whichpowas his life, has spent its strength, and
brought him to this hour;

When, as the darkness glooms and falls* upon his
glazing eyes,

They turn their last beclouded glauce up to the
starh’t skien

When, mid delirium’a horror, on his lips a single
word
Breathed for the last time, faintly munds-that word

Thy name, Ο Lord;
