IDEM 161

“But fair and fresh the band from upper air.
Then do these pilgrims, one and all,
Flock to the meadow‚* and encamp them there
As at a festival.

“And sweet the courtesles and questioning
of friends unseen since long ago;
‘In Heaven was such the mode of wayfaringl
What cheer was theire below l'

“Strange sights the earth-stained saw, sad suffering
his l
For very ruth he needs must weep3
One tells of joys and magio mysteries-

He scaled the heavenly steep!

“A thousand years-so long has been the way-
Ten years to every year of man,
Tenfold the recompensa that each must pay,
Once in each age’s span.

¹* eie τὸν λειμῶνα. “The'' meadow, well known in Greek
mythology from the description, more especially, ol Homer.
