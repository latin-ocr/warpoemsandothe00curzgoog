XLVIII
THE SKYLARK

BIRD of the wilderness,

Blithesome and cumberlest,
Sweet be thy matin o’er moorland and lea!
Emblem of happiness,
Blest is thy dwelling·place-
Oh! to abide in the desert with thee!

Wild is thy lay and lond,

Far in the downy cloud:
Love gives it energy, love gave it birth;

Where, on thy dewy wing‚

Where art thou journeying?

Thy lay ison heaven, thy love is on earth.

O’er fell and fountain sheen,
O'er moor and mountain green,
O‘er the red streamer that heralds the day,
