THE BELGIAN FLAG 15

To the flag, the flzg, my children,
Heurken to your country‘s cry!

Never has it shone so splendid,
Nevet has it flown so high!

Red sor the flames in fury,
Black, yellow and ted—-
Black for the mourning ashes,
Black, yellow and red-
And yellow of gold,⁴ as we proudly hail

The spirits of the dead!

To the flag, my sont! Your country

With her bleuing “Forward'’ criesl
Has it shrunken? No, when smallest,
Latger, statulier, it fliesl
Is it uttered? No, ’tis stoutest
When destruction it defles!
