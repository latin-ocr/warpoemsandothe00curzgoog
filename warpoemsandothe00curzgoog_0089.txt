XVIII
THE TWO VOICES

I SUNG the joyful Paean clear,
And, sitting, burnish’d without sear
The band, the buckier, and the spear-

Waiting to strive a happy strife,

To war with falsehood to the knife‚
And not tolose the good of life.

At least, not rotting like a weed,

But, having sown some genereus seed,
Fruitful of further thought and dect,

To past, when Life her light withdraws,

Not void os righteous sels-applause,
Nor in a merely selfish cause—
