XXXVI
LOVE SONG FROM THE INDIAN

Î™ WOULD have toru the sturs from the heavens

for your necklace,
I would have stripped the rose-leaves for your
conch from all the trees,
1 would have spoiled the East of its apices for your
persume,
The West of all its wonders, to endower you with
these.

I would bave drained the ocean, to find its rarest
pasl-drops,
And melt them for your lightest thirst in ruby
draughts of wine3
1 would have dug for gold, till the earth was void
of treasure,
That, since you had no riches, you might freely
take of mine.
