THE VISION OF MIRZAH 213

“But tell me why srom out a mist that sea

Rises, and in amitt is lost‚'’-
“It is that portion of Eternity
Which mortal man harh crossed‚

. From the beginning to the end of all;
Time isit, measured by the sun.
Note now this flood betwixt the cloudy pall,
And see what there is done.’' ’

“A bridge I see which that great gulf doth span,
Stretched 0’er the middle of the tide.”--¹
“The bridge before thee is the life of man,
Look close on· it Ι ''-he cried

So gazing, Ι beheld how arches ridge
The watery gulf, three seore and ten3

Yet, were not many turned, 'neath the bridge
A hundred there had been.

E’en as I counted, he the sum confessed-
“A thousand arches erst there were3
Carne a great flood thet overwhelmed the rest
And left those ruins there.
