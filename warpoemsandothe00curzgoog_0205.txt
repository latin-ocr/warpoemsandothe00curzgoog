XLIV

THE PROGRESS OF POESY
A PINDARIC ODE

OODS that wave 0'er Delphi's steep‚

Isles that crown the Aegean deep,
F ields that cool Illissus laves,

Or where Maeander’s amber waves

In lingering labyrinths creep3

How do your tuneful echoes languish
Mute but to the voice of anguish!
Where each old poetic mountain
Inspiration breathed around 3
Every shade and hallowed fountain
Murmured deep a solemn sound;
Till the sad Nine in Greece’s evil hour

Left their Parnassus for the Latian plain&
