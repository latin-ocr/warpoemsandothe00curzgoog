FROM THE JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY
FOR PSYCHICAL RESEARCH

IN THE AFGHAN WAR

THE autumn sun was dying3
F lushed with its light the scene,

Dark earth below, the blood-red glow,
And a belt of gold between.

Its molten trail swept oâ€™er her,
As she sat apart from all,

And the ruddy gleam of the fading beam
Made patterns on the wall.

But she looked not on the sumet,

To its pomp her eyes were dim-

F or honour sworn his sword was drawn-
She thought alone of him.
