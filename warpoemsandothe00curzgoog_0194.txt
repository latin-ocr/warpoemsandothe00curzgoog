IDEM 173
“Yet is no life ordained for good or ill;

Man’s is the choice, and man's alone.
On earth the knowledge and the changeless will

The wisc man makes his own.

“And evermore resounds the herald’s voice5
‘E’en for the last is favour fair.
Let not the first be heedless of his choice,
Nor the hindmost despair !'

“Then one with blinded witless eyes of greed
Elects a bloody tyrant's lot.
Anon remorsefully bewails the deed

And weeping ceaseth not.

÷ “Yet in his pride himself he doth acquit;
‚ At Fate and the High Gods he raves3
Right had he known erewhile‚ and walked in it,

But lacked the truth that saves.
