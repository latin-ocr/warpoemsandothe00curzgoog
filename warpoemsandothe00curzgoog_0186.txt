IDEM 165

“And trail that wretched body, which like wool
Is carded upon thorns, and tell
Wherefore the sinner’s cup of wrath is full,
His spirit plunged to hell.

“ Of all grim terrors of the underworld

Grimmest the terror of that voice,
Which if they hear not through the portals whirled
The souls mount and rejoice.

“So they for seven days in the joyous mead
Linges-then pass-then on a morn,
The fourth that flushes on their steadfast speed
With rosy roofs of dawn,

“Deep in the luminous dim void a light,
Straight as a pillared shaft and high,
Glitters like Iris’ bow, yet is more bright,

And pierces earth and sky.

“Thro' all one day that wonder grows apsce-
And now, the middle rays among,

They see where from the invisible eope of space
The chains of heaven are hung.
