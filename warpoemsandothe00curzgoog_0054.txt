TO THE GERMAN ARMY

I pray the streams-our streams-may leap
In floods above their banks and sweep
Your trampling hosts to dooml

Ι pray the spectres of our slain
May haunt you in your tento-
Vigil or sleep, whiche'er you seck-
Nought smelling but the bloody reek
Of our Holy Innocents.

I pray the ruins of our homes

May crush you like a worm,
Your hrains beneath the torment recl,
Doubt from your hearts their fury steal,
Fear drive you like brute beasts that squeal

And fly before the storml

Ι pray that you may live to bear

Each pang that marked our path3
Then God may at the last relent,
And spate your soulu the chastisement

Of his eternal wrathl
