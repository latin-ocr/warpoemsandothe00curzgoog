218 THE VISION OF MIRZAH

Forthwith Ι gazed as hidden-haply he
With force divine my sight endowed‚

Or—deigning Ι should pierce the gloom and see-
Rolled back that misty cloud.

The vale 1 saw, where it more open grows,
Spread forth into a mighty main,
And there a rock of adamant uprose‚
That seveted it in twain.

One hals was by the cloudy veil o’ercast-

So thick that nought therein was known,
It seemed the other was an ocean vast,
With isles unnumbered strown.

Covered they were with fruits and hlootn of flowers,
And through them ran a thousand scas
With shining current, and, amid the bowers‚

Or threading the tall trees,

A throng 1 saw, in glorious habits dressed,
That garlands on their temples wore,
And some beside the fountains took their rest,
Some on the flowery floor3
