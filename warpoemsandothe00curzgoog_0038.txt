,ι WHERESOE’ER you will to lead us,

ff We will follow you full fain,

· Through the woods and through the meadows,
¹ Through the frost and through the rain.

- 1f you bid us shed our life-blood,

Sire, the last drop you may drain.

We will do whate'er you're doing,
Where you go, sire, we will go,
¹. Heedless that on every foot-track
Fires will burn and tears must flow.
'Mid the tumult of the fighting,
Clash of slayers and of slain,

’Mid ¹the whistling of the bullets
And the moans of those in pain.
