F OR THE SOLDIERS' PIPE

ΜΑΝΥ a secret lies herein
That should not be told,
Many a whispered foolishness,
Many a thing that to confess
Might be everbold.
Lies herein my naked beart,
Innocent of thame-

To give our lads one pipe the more
On the field of famel

Lies herein my inmost soul

Bared by month and day3
Tars and laughter without thyme‚
Whatsoe'er at any time

Faith or love would say. „
