IDEM
ANGLICE REDDITUM

OR those by love or kinship dear
Shed lightly, friend, the mournful tear; ·

They are not dead, but gone before
By the road to all men fated.
Soon too shall we, each in our turn,
Their footsteps follow to that bourn,
To live through time for evermore

With those dear ones re-mated.
