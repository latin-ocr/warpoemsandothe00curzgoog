BELLS OF FLANDERS

Ohl belle, from out your steeples
Fling forth your call to armo!
Ring out! Ring οη1 Βίης madly
The valiant Flemish peel!

The fell sword of the troopere-
1 Brief triumph shall they know-

Upon your soil ancestral

E'en now your sons lays low!
But to the ruthless victor

Your freedorn deor you sell,
Proud, dauntless, little nation,

Whom only numbers quell!

Ring out! Βίης οη1 Βίης sadly
The noble Flemish peel!

But see! in the dark heavens

The dawn of justice light 1
There to the dim horizon

The brutel horde takes flight.
The radiant day of glory

Day of revenge is here,
