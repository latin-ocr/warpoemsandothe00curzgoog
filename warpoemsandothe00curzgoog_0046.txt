‘THE FLIGHT INTO ENGLAND 25

“We seek new men, we seek new skiee,
New hearts, new sauls, new life,

To ehield the blessed Sonos God
From the blast of deadly strife?

Eorward through the dark blue night
They have ssed, with foot to fleet‚

The sound of their footfall dies away
And is lost in the desert street,

And the wind has swept from. every path
The traces of their feet.
