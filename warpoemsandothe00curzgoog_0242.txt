THE VISION OF MIRZAH 221

Fled was the Spirit. Then I turned asido,
That radiant vision not to miss-

Gone was the archkd bridge, the rolling tide,
Vanished the isles of blissl

Naught Î™ beheld but Bagdad's hollow vale,
And there, as down its length I gazed,

Oxen and sheep and camele, in the dale,

Upon the pasture grazed.
