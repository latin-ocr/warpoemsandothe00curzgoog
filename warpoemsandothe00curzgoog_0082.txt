IDEM
ANGLICE REDDITUM

HESE are the heroes, for their country's weal
Who dated the strife and made the proud foe
reel.
’Twixt praise and shame-sor such high stakes
they vied-
Careless of living, Death they bade decide.
And this for Hellas’ sake, that she might be
From tyrant’s pride and yoke of bondsmen free.
Sore was their toil-but now their motherland’s

Dear bosom folds them-so great'Zeus commands.

Unfailing, all-availing‚ is his power,
To men no respite gives he from their hour.
