THE VISION OF MIRZAH 215

Till at the last each one was seen to fall
When all his strength was gone,

Long time upon that wondrour pile I gazed
And that great crowd of passers-by,
Nor least, regarding them, my heart was dazed
And plunged in melancholy,

When many a happy one, from out the band, ι ”
Dropped straight to an untimely grave, .
Clutching where’er he could, with desperate hand,
If he his life might save.

Some with uplifted eye and thoughtful mien
Seemed lost in a celestial sphere,
But midway in that reverie were seen
Stumbling, to disappear. ·

And multitudes were eager in the chase‚
Whom bubbies gleamed and danced before,
Yet often, as they thought to win the tace,
Their footsteps on the floor
