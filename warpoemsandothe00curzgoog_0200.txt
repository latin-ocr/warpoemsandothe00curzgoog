IDEM 179

“ Marvellous the water that no cup can fill;

· Thereof each soul must drinlr somewhat,
And he that drinketh of the sleepy rill

Hath straight all things forgot.
‘d

“Then slumber laps thern, till at middle night
With earthqualre-shoclr and thunder-jars

. Suddenly scattered they are rvhirled to light

Shot up like flying stars Ι ”

These things the hero saw, but of that stream
Might he not slake his least desire.
Naught knew he after, tili the morning bean
Thrilled on the funeral pyre.
