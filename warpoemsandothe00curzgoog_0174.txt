Tne ΜΥΤΗ or nn
OR, THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL

[THE following is an attempt to render in English

verse, and in the metrepopularised byTennyson
in the “Palace of Art‚'’ the most beautiful of the various
myths or allegorico by which the genius of Plato sought
to illustrate his belief in the Immortality of the Soul.
Here, in the tenth book of the “ Republic‚'’ as in the
“Gorgias ” and “ Phaedo,’' he depicts its destinies after
death, the Judgment, the Millennium of atonement
for evil and recompenso for good, the accomplished
< purification, the choice of new life, the draught of
oblivion‚ and the second return to the world. With

a belief in the ‘imperishable quality of the spiritual

ensence is combined the doctrine of Metempeychosis‚
or transfer of souls, not merely from man to man, bur
from man to animal and vice versa, which had its

' origin in the immemorial and unfathomable religiono

of the East.
