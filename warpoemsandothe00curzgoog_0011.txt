vi PREFACE

Belgian writer, M. Eruile Commaerts, I hove
received so many requests from readers and pub·
lishers for the wider circulation of these efforts, that

I hove agreed to their re-issue in a less fingitive ἵ

form-the proceeds, if there are any, to he devoted
to the Belgian Relief Fund. I have added several
other translations which have at differem times lent
distractior to ony leisnre hours ; and these include two
from another Belgian tuan of letters, a great poet and ⁵
artist, M. Etnile Verhaeren.

Upon the general principles to he obseroed in the '

translation of poetry into a foreign tangue, I would

say this: The translator should, Ithink‚ rememher ;

that the worh is not primarily ht's, hul that of p
another man, of whose ideas he is merely the vehicle
and interpretem and, while endeavouring to convert
theru into the idiorn and metricalfotrn of another lan·

guage, oJ‘cen with sonte loss, rarely with any goin, in Ἴ
the process, he should as far as possible subordinate
himself to the conception and thought, ana even deser, ⁷
where possible, tothetechniquc of the original writer.
