Lies herein my naked beart,
Stripped of all disguise-

To give our lads one pipe the more
'Neath the starry skiesl

Sings herein my artless muse-
Let the scoffers jem,

Cadence of my verse impugn,

Say my lyre is out of tune
And my fancy sere.

Lies herein my naked beart-

Let the mockers rail-

But give our lads one pipe the more
'Neath the lenden hail!
