viii PREFACE

ancient is o diffierem matter. It is an exereise of
much attraction aud has provoked the expenditure
⁴of no small ingenuity. Butone cannot help wondering
what ou ancient (Jreek or Roman would have
thought of the lambics or Elegiacs ofeven the most
erudite of modern classical scholam, much more of the
mediocre practitianer. On the other hand, that a
modern author need not always or necessarily suffer
in the process of translation into au ancient tougne is
shown hy the well-known case of Robert Browuing‚
who declared that he had never fully understood his
own arnaning rhapsody of Abt Vogler until he saw
it translated into a Greek Pindaric Ode hy the late

Professor Jehh.

I am indehted to M. Verhaeren and M. Caumaerts
for permission to print the originals of their poetas,
arrd to soene of myfriends for having looked through
these translations.
