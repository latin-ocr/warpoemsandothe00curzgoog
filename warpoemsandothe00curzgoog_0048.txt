THE BLIND MAN AND HIS SON

“THE distant boom of 3118ῐῖ 8⁰⁰⁸
No longer fills my ear·

Oh! whither have we fled, my son?
Tell me, that I may hear.''
“Father, we are in England!”

“No morel hear the stormy wind
Amid ¹the rigging roar,
1· feel beneath my tottering feet
The firm ground of the shore.
Is this the end of all our woes?
shall we not suffer more?’'
“Father, we are in England Ι”

“Ι hear the sound of kindly speech,
But do not understand,
I feel I've wandered very far,
