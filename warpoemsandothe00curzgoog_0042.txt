God protect you, our protector,
You our shield, Sire, may He shield,
King of F umes, the soldiere' monarch,
King who seorned his pledge to yield3

King of acres-few there be-

Pride and glory os our Homeland,
Warden of Humanity!

Wheresoe'er you will to lead ue,
We will come full fain,

If you bid us shed our life-blood,
Sire, 'tis yours to drain!
