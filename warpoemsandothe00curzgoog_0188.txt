' IDEM 167

“In sooth the belt of heaven is that great light,
Bracing the mighty circle round,
What wise with cables girded trimly-tight
The ocean-hulls are bound*

“And lo! down reaching from those chains begun
The spindle of the Law Sublime,
Necessity, whereby the world is spun
Through endless grooves of Time.

“Of steel the shaft is wrought the hook of steel,
But of mixed fashioning the whorl,
Wherein seven other circlos, wheel in wheel,
Continuously curl.

the Milky Wey. 1f the former is Plato’s meaning, there is the
iurther difficulty oi understanding the relation oi the pillar oi
light to the shait oi Necessity¹s spindle, which is aleo described

as the axis piercing the middiemost oi the eight orbits. The
second interpretation may indeed be reconciled with the

phrases that have suggested the first by enpposing that Er
¹ and his companions first caught sight oi the light at a point
in space where it appeared to their eyes to be perpendicular
rather than circular. But why Plato should have introduced
an optieal illusion into his story it is hard to say. A scholar
friend tells me he thinks that the image was probably suggested
by the elliptical ⁶· pillar” of the Zodiacal light.
