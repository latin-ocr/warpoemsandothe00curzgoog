MY HEART IN RUINS

BNG ago my heart was like a Roman palate,
Made of choice granites, decked with marbles

rare ·
Soon came the passione like a horde of vandala,
Came and invaded it, with axe and torch aglare.

Then it was a tuin. Not a human sound there!
Only owlt and vipers-wastes of creeping flowers ;
Porphyry, carrara, everywhere lay broken,
Brambles had 'o'ergrown the pathe between the
bowers·

Long time, alone, Ι gazed on my disaster,
Many a sunless noontide, many a starless night
Passed‚ and I lived there days begirt with horror,
Till thou appearedst, white in the light.
Bravely then, to find a lodgtng for our two loves,
Buildedtl my hut from the ruins of that site.
