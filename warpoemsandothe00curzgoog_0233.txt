Then did 1, ravished by there strairrs divine,
To rpeak with the musiciarr yearrr3
But, while Ι gazed astonied, with a sign
He beckoned me to turn.

Theren, with humble reverence drawing nigh,
Before his feet in tears I fell3
But he, with smiles and pitying courtesy‚ ,
Did al} my fears dispel,

And lifting me, that found as yet rro word,
Did gently take me by the hand,
Saying, “Thy musings‚ Mirzah, have I heard,
Follow, ’tis my command l'' ’

so, where the rock soars highest to the skies,

Guiding my steps, he set me there,

And spake again, “To eastward cast thine eyes,
And what thou seest declare 1”

“I see a valley, arrd a water wide
Rolling therein,”-I made reply.
“That vale,” he naid, “is Misery, and the tide
Is called Eternity.''
