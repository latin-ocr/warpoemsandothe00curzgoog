AMOURS DE VOYAGE
camos 111, 1v

HEREF ORE farewell ye hille, and γε, ye
envineyarded ruins,
Therefore sarewell γε walls, palaces, pillars‚ and
domesl
Therefore fareweH, far seen, ye peaks of the mythic
Albano,
seen from Mentorio's height, Tibur and Aesula’s
hius!
Ah, could we once, ere we go, could we stand,
while to Ocean descending

Sinks o'er the yellow dark plain slowly the yellow

broad sun,
stand, from the forest emerging at sunset, at once
in the champaign,
Open, but studded with trees, chestnuts um·
brageous and old,
