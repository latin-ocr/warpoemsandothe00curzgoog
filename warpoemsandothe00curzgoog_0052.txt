TO THE GERMAN ARMY
A NEW YEAR’S PRAYER, 1915*

Ι PRAY that every passing hour
Your hearts may bruise and beat,
Ι pray that every step you take
May scorch and seer your feet!

Ι pray that Beauty never more
May charm your eyes, your ears,

That you may march, through day and night,
Beneath a heaven of tem,

Blind to the humblest flowers that in
The hedgerow·corners bloom,

Deaf to whatever round or cry

. May wake in you the memory

Of dear ones left at home.

I pray your guno may be engulfed
Beneath the loom-our loaml

poem by myrelf. with loud denunciatione of the ferociores epirit
of the English writer.
