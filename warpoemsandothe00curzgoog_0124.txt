THE MARBLE HEART

Y heart a marble was, reared in a bramble waste,
That in a common path, for all to see, was

placed,
Where Chance upon the stone with hand untiring

wrote
Some name that by the rain was tpeedily washed out.

But Love tore up the weeds and brambles that
were there,

And angrily he took and flung them in the air,

And slowly did engrave‚ with true and steadfast hand,

One name, carved deep thenon, that evermore will
stand.

Then withan iron rail he did the spot surround ·
And set four statues at the cornert of the ground,
On whose white marble limbs a robe of brass was

bound.
