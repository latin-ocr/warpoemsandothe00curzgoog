204 AMOURS DE VOYAGE

There is ι home 00 the shore of the Alpine sea,
that upnwelling
High up the mountain sides, sprads in the
hollow between,
Wilderness‚ mountain, and 0001 stom the land of
the olive conceal it,
Under Pilatus' hill low by the river it lies3
Italy, utter the word, and the olive and vine will
allure not,
Wilderneoe, forest and sumn, will not the passage

impede.
