THE v1s10N oF Mlnznn 219

And in my ears a mingled harmony

Of falling waters, birds that sang,

Men’s voices, instruments of melody,
With sweet confusion tang.

I gazed and hearkened. Gladness grew in tne
At sight of this divine retreat, ,
An eagle’s wings I coveted, to flee
To that enehanted seat.

But, “Passage is there none by any wiles,

Save through the hidden gates of death

That open ever on the bridge. The isles
So fresh and green ''-he seith-

“That dot the ocean, far as it expands,

Far as thy vision sweeps, are more
In number than the innumerable sands
That lie upon the shore.

Myriads there are, the nearer scats behind,

Whither not eye nor thought can reach,

Mansions to good men after death assigned,
As is the worth of each.
