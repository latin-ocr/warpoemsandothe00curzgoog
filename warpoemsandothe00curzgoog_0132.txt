THE EPITAPH OF SCARRON

OF him whose testing-place you view

Pity, not envy, was the due;
A thousand times he suffered death

While on this earth he still drew breath.
Ohl passer by, make here no noise,

Let no man wake him with his voice3
For ne’er‚ before this night, did sleep
Upon poor Scarron's eyelids creep.
