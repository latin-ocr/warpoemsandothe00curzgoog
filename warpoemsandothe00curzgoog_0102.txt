ANTONIO MORE

FROM their frames of black and gold
Gaze the figures mute and told
Whom Antonio More of old

Limned-the silence of their stare
Doth torment me everywhere3
Masks of clay their faces are.

Hard the features, and there lien
Evil in those austere eyes,'
With their unprobed mysteries.

Baton, doctor, captain shows
Cruelty in high repom,
Pride that no concession knows.

F ingers long and lean have they,
Fingers apt with toys to play
Or an empite to betray.
