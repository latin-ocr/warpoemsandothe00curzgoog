220 THE VISION OF MIRZAH

There are they settled, and the isles abeund
With joys of manifold degrees,
And of those pleasures each is perfect found
To suit their relishes.

So is each place to each a paradise,
Worthy of long esshy. Confeoe,
O Mimh, if it yieldeth such a prizp,
Is life unhappiness?

Can death be fearful‚ that to such delight
Conducteth? Think nht that in vain

Was man created, when a lot so bright

For him doth aye hymn?

With joy ineffable 1 cast ¹my §yes
Upon the happy islands‚ then
Rejoined‚ “I pray thee show me that which lies
Hidden from mortal ken

Beneath those vapours that the ocean cloud,
Beyond the adamantine peak.”
But when no answer he returned, I howed,
A second time to speak.
