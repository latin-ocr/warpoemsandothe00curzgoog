SONG ,oF THE BELGIANS

RECK not that your wounds are bleeding,
Reek not that your voice is weak:
Louder than the roar os cannen,
Higher than the battle-shriek‚
Sing, my countrymen, the story
Of the fields we have not won,
Fields of failure but of glory,
’Neath this fair autumna! sun:
Sing how, when the temptet whispered,
“Buy your safety with your shame,’'
said we, “Sooner no dishonour

shall defile the Belgian name ”l

Here, amid the smoking ruins,
Dinant, Aerschot, Termond,

Beat the drum and blow the bugle,
Dance to the unwonted sound!
