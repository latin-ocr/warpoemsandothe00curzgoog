THE VISION OF MIRZAH

{osum thohou-mu socom-ou,
0· 159

AVING once ventured on the observation that

Addison's famous allegory was really opoent,
which only by accident had not assumed a metrical
form,⁸ 1 was challenged to vindicate this contention,
with fidelity to the language as well as the spirit
of the original. The following was the result of
the attempt:

In Bagdad city, gift with lofty hills,†
Upon the fifth day of the moon,
Which day our saith with ttrict observance fills,
Did Ι, ’ere yet 'twas hoen,

· The sententious Bishop nard, who edited Addison’s Worko
ln 1811, sold about this essay: “Mr. Addieon lo a much better
poet in prose than in verse. This vision has ull the merit ol tho
fiuent cantolu Spenser.''

† This is ol course ι poetic limace, there being no bins et or
neor to Bagded. ’
