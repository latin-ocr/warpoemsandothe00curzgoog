NEVER,’' you said, that day when I and you
Heard the resounding plaint of Schubert’s

son .
ς(Νενοτ,Ξ you said, albeit, to prove you wrong,
Your great eyes shone a melancholy blue.

ὲ “Never,’'-you said again, so mild and pale

One seemed to see some old medallion smile.

2 Yet the proud blush of modesty the while
ss Crimsoned your cheeks, as with ajealous veil. .

Lady‚ to breathe that word a pity were l
For while of love I spoke‚ this face so fair,
This smile'divine, did not my vision fill.
