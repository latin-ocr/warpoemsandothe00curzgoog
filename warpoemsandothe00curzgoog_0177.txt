THE MYTH OF ER
(Plato, “ Republic‚” Bk. x. 614-621)

“I will tell you . . . a tale osa hero, Er, the son
of Armenius, a Pamphylian by birth. He was stain
in battle, and ten days afterwards, when the bodies of
the dead were taken up already in a state of corruption,
his body was found unaffecred by deeay, and carried
away home to be buried. And on the twelfth day,
as he was lying on the funeral pile, he returned to life
and told them what he had seen in the other world. ’

He said that when his soul left the body he went on a

journey with a great company, and that they came to

emysterious place ar which there were two openings
in the earth ; they were near together, and over against

them were two other openings in the heaven above.
