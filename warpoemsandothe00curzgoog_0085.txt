HEBREW MELODIES

THY days are done, thy fame begun3

Thy country’s strains record
The triumphs of her chosen son,
The slaughters of his sword,
The deeds he did, the fields he w0n‚

The freedorn he restored!

Though thou art fall’n‚ while we are free,
Thou shalt not taste of death!
· The genereus blood that flowed from thee
Disdained to sink beneath:
Within our veins its currents be,
Thy spirit on our breath!

Thy name our charging hosts along
shall be the battle-word,
