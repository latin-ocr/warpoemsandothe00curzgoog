XLV
THE VOICE OF THE SEA

THOU art nounding on, thou mighty sea,
For ever and the same!

The ancient rocks yet ring to then
Those thunders nought ean tame.

Oh i many a glorious voice is gone
From the rich bowers of earth,

And hushed is many a lovely one

Of mournfulness or mirth.

The Dorian flute that sighed of yore
Along the wave, is sti113

The harp of Judah peals no more
On Zion’s awful hili.

And Memnon’s lyre hath lost the chord
That brenthed the mystic tone3

And the songs at Rome's high triumphs poured
Are with her eagles flown.
