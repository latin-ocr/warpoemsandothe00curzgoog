A VISION

nnon «nnn GATE on now
(virgil, nnn m, 895)

THE winds of heaven waft her
Tbrough shutter bolts and bars,
Like metente streaming after
From worlds beyond the stare.

Through shutter bars and casement
Behold the vision glidel

And now with sweet amazement
1 see it at my side.

With lover's arms extended
Ι claim her for my own3
That beauty rare and splendid
Is mine, is mine alone.

She benis, she breathes, her kisses
Rain lightly on my bion.
